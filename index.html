        <h1>Le-co native grid</h1>
        <h2>Minimalistic framework for native CSS Grid based on 12col grids</h2>

        <p>
            Just grab <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-saling/Le-co-Grid/master/dist/grid.css">this little FW</a> and give it a go.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note #1</b>: Even though this is a grid system in traditional sense of the word you might be familiar and
            comfortable with don't forget, that this application is really just the tip of the iceberg of options Native
            CSS grids provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note #2</b>: Don't forger to tweak variables to suite your needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note #3</b>: You might need to enable some <a href="http://christopher.org/setting-chrome-flags-for-experimental-web-browser-layout-features/">flags</a>            in your browser to get this working.
        </p>

        <p>
            This work was inspired by: <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2015/02/04/css-grid-layout-creating-complex-grids/">CSS Grid Layout - creating complex grids</a>
        </p>

        <h3>How this works?</h3>

        <p>To enable grid layout add class <code>.grid</code> to continaer. Then by using correct class combinations your can pick where you grid cell should being (starting column/row line) and to where it should span (end line). For example, if you want you cell to start at first column line and first row line you'd used classes <code>.gc-s1</code> ("gc" as in <i>grid column</i> and "s" as in <i>start</i>) and <code>.gr-s1</code> and to end at the end of third column on second line you'd add <code>.gc-e4</code> and <code>.gr-e2</code>.</p>

        <p>Gotchas: When assigning rows, you can leave it up to browser or you can add class <code>.vertical</code> to <code>.grid</code> to have rows with minimal 10px of height. At this point, this class is mostly usefull to check if you layed out cells correctly and that you are not skipping rows by having too high cells (which is fine, but it may lead to confusion when reading classes on cells).</p>

        <p>Keep in mind, that his project is not final or perfect. It will however allow you to familiarise with yourself with native CSS grids via industry standard 12col grid.</p>
