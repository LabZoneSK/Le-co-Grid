        <h1>Le-co native grid</h1>
        <h2>Minimalistic framework for native CSS Grid based on 12col grids</h2>

        <p>
            Native CSS grids are cool to use and learn. Just grab <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad-saling/Le-co-Grid/master/dist/grid.css">this little FW</a> and give it a go.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note #1</b>: Even though this is a grid system in traditional sense of the word you might be familiar and
            comfortable with don't forget, that this application is really just the tip of the iceberg of options Native
            CSS grids provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note #2</b>: Don't forger to tweak variables to suite your needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note #3</b>: You might need to enable some <a href="http://christopher.org/setting-chrome-flags-for-experimental-web-browser-layout-features/">flags</a>            in your browser to get this working.
