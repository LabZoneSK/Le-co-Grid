            <h1>Le-co native grid</h1>

                <p>
                 Minimalistic framework uses well known concept of 12 col grid to demonstrate principles of native CSS Grid Layout.

            <h2>How this works?</h2>

            <p>Class <code>.grid</code> trigger grid layout. Add <code>.gutter</code> for gutter. If you add <code>.vertical</code> you'll get rows with <code>1px</code> for layout debugging. Classnames on grid cells define where grid cells start and end (both in column and row direction). </p>

             <p><b>Example</b>: <code>.gc-s1 .gc-e3 .gr-s1 .gr-e2</code> will translate into cell starting at column grid line 1 and, ending at column grid line 3, starting at row line 1 and ending at row line 2.</p>


             <h2>Notes</h2>
