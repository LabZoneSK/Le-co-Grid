        <p>
            This grid system uses well known concept of 12 col grid to demonstrate principles of native CSS Grid Layout, however native grids can do so much more and I encourage you to explore them further.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note #1</b>: You can tweak variables to modify grid for your needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note #2</b>: You might need to enable some <a href="http://christopher.org/setting-chrome-flags-for-experimental-web-browser-layout-features/">flags</a>            in your browser to get this working.
        </p>

        <p>
            This work was inspired by: <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2015/02/04/css-grid-layout-creating-complex-grids/">CSS Grid Layout - creating complex grids</a>
        </p>

        <h3>How this works?</h3>

        <p>To enable grid layout add class <code>.grid</code> to continer. In case you want gutter, make it <code>.grid.gutter</code>. Then by using correct class combinations your can pick where you grid cell should being (starting column/row line) and to where it should span (end line). For example, if you want you cell to start at first column line and first row line you'd used classes <code>.gc-s1</code> ("gc" as in <i>grid column</i> and "s" as in <i>start</i>) and <code>.gr-s1</code> and to end at the end of third column on second line you'd add <code>.gc-e4</code> and <code>.gr-e2</code>.</p>

        <p>Gotchas: When assigning rows, you can leave it up to browser or you can add class <code>.vertical</code> to <code>.grid</code> to have 12 rows with minimal 1px of height. At this point, this class is mostly usefull to check if you layed out cells correctly and that you are not skipping rows by having too high cells (which is fine, but it may lead to confusion when reading classes on cells).</p>
