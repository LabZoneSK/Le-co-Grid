            We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I
            see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've
            said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy.
            We need to neutralize the homing signal.

            Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back in time?
            We are going to Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations prompted by minor read-out anomalies. Probes have
            recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. Assemble a team. Look at records of
            the Drema quadrant. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions as well as natural signals?
